    <h2>Who am I?</h2>

            <p>Hi! My name is Tiago, I'm 21 years old and currently live in Porto, Portugal most of the time.
                I'm currently a graduate student of Physics at the University of Porto writing my master's thesis on localization properties
                of bidimensional materials subjected to an incommensurate potential. <br>
                Besides my thesis work I find my time divided among other things that catch my interest and I find pleasing 
                to investigate which include, but are not limited to: history, linguistics, and <em>historical linguistics</em> 
                among others. <br>
                Hand-in-hand with my keen interest in linguistics is a great curiosity about language learning in its many forms - 
                from hearing languages spoken to delving into the grammatical aspects of a language I find interesting and sometimes
                a commitment to achieve a considerable level of fluency as is the case currently with the German language that has been
                my target language since about March 2021 with relative seriousness and from July 2021 onwards in a more dilligent manner.
                <strong>Updates on German progress and maybe a blog with entries describing my methods and strategies</strong>
                <br>
                Alongside all these interests is an everpresent enjoyment of reading about these subjects as well as more
                general literary classics and modern fantasy books <strong>Reviews may be good entries to the site</strong>.

    <h2>Academic Background</h2>  
        <p>
            I did my undergrad in Physics at the University of Porto that gave me the necessary mathematical foundation to 
            then study the basic elements of Physics, namely Classical Mechanics, Electromagnetism and Thermodynamics both in their theoretical and experimental aspects. 
            I also had an introductory class to programming in Python that was then reinforced and applied 
            to physical simulations in courses where I was taught various numerical methods.
            I also decided to complement my mathematical curriculum with more abstract and advanced classes such as 
            Group Theory and Complex Analysis that proved useful in future courses. <br>
            By the end of my undergraduate journey I was able to learn about more advanced topics in Physics such as Quantum Mechanics, Relativity and Optics
            as well as participate in an extracurricular internship studying Quantum Matter (more specifically, graphene Kirigami lattices) which has since 
            become the main focus of my graduate work. <br>
            When I began graduate school I also found new interests in areas beyond Physics and have therefore taken courses related to Data Science and 
            Computer Science.
